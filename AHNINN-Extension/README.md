AHNINN-Extension
==============

An extension to interface with the AHNI library for neuro-evolution,
 so we can use the neural networks that get evolved in a NetLogo model...


## Using

I'm just making this for one project, not really for general use, but if you want to get it working for your own projects, good luck to you!

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogo.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0 make

If compilation succeeds, `ahninn.jar` will be created.

## Credits

This extension was written (hacked together hastily) by Forrest Stonedahl.

## Terms of Use

The AHNI library that this extension uses is GPL, and you can find the source code for it, along with all the appropriate credits for those who contributed to it, here:

https://github.com/OliverColeman/ahni

(I believe that also requires this project be licensed as GPL...)
